# Meta-interdisciplinarity

This repository will feature data and materials at the intersection of meta-science and interdisciplinarity.  

Points to consider:

1) field-finding 

* Twitter thread: Michael Nielsen, field and problem finding ([Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1020717496301772802)).

* Quote from Twitter thread on problem-finding: "make progress on big problems that are more or less obvious to everyone".

* recent example (April 2019): "Machine Behavior" -- Nature, [doi:10.1038/s41586-019-1138-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1138-y).

2) connectivity between fields.

* example (June 2012): "Design and Update of a Classification System: The UCSD Map of Science" -- PLoS One, [doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0039464](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0039464).

3) fields as syntactic components and clusters.

* example: "How to find a scientific revolution: intellectual field formation and the analysis of terms", PsyarXiv, [doi:10.31234/osf.io/rhs9g](https://psyarxiv.com/rhs9g/).

4) deep vs. broad knowledge.

* skillset geometries. Referenced in [Synthetic Daisies, February 16, 2017](https://syntheticdaisies.blogspot.com/2017/02/a-peripheral-darwin-day-post-but.html)
