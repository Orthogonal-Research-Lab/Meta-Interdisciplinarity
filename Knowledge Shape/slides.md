Is and Ts have been defined by a wide range of human resources experts, while varied sources also refer to the “comb” motif as an “M” or “overlapping Ts”. In terms of the technology industry, the T-shaped skill set is becoming increasingly useful.

We can consider these archetypes as one of four combinations: depth but no breadth (I), breadth but no depth (dash), depth in a single area with breadth (T), and depth in multiple areas with breadth (comb). That gives us one type of generalist (dash), one type of specialist (I), and two types of hybrid generalist/specialist (T, comb). A pure generalist is someone who has cross-disciplinary competence, while a pure specialist has deep competency in a single field. Depth and breadth both refer to the set of knowledge domains, which has linguistic (breadth) and specificity/conditionality (depth) components (see Figure 1).

An assumption is made that knowing the language (terminology) of a given knowledge domain provides a relative degree of breadth in expertise. For this reason, knowledge of multiple terminology sets is a bridge between knowledge domains. Deeper knowledge is often conditional on other facts, or has specificity that is only understood by knowing a large constellation of facts. In either case, a significant number of domain-specific facts must be in place before depth is acquired.

### Definition of the Knowledge Domain

Language (terminology). The breadth of an individual’s knowledge domains can be defined as a terminology set shared only within a given area of knowledge. A terminology set, or set of words often referred to as jargon, are technical words that are otherwise rare in usage or definition. Knowledge of these exclusive words, and the lack of knowledge of words exclusive to other areas of knowledge, define a specialist. More specifically, this defines the top of the I-shaped skillset.

Specificity and Conditionality. The depth of an individual’s knowledge domain has two components: specificity and conditionality. Unlike in the case of restricted terminology, specificity refers to the narrowness of a fact in a given subject area. This could be defined more intuitively as trivia, and is further defined by its degree of self-reference to other facts in the same topical area (see Figure 2). By contrast, conditionality refers to the intersubjectivity of a given fact. This is related to how much context is required to understand the significance of the original fact. Using a semantic web or facts, a fact of high conditionality is tightly interconnected with other facts in the same topical area. This same group of facts are not interconnected with facts from other areas of knowledge, thus creating a closed set of deep facts.
