Is and Ts have been defined by a wide range of human resources experts, while varied sources also refer to the “comb” motif as an “M” or “overlapping Ts”. In terms of the technology industry, the T-shaped skill set is becoming increasingly useful.

We can consider these archetypes as one of four combinations: depth but no breadth (I), breadth but no depth (dash), depth in a single area with breadth (T), and depth in multiple areas with breadth (comb). That gives us one type of generalist (dash), one type of specialist (I), and two types of hybrid generalist/specialist (T, comb). A pure generalist is someone who has cross-disciplinary competence, while a pure specialist has deep competency in a single field. Depth and breadth both refer to the set of knowledge domains, which has linguistic (breadth) and specificity/conditionality (depth) components (see Figure 1).

An assumption is made that knowing the language (terminology) of a given knowledge domain provides a relative degree of breadth in expertise. For this reason, knowledge of multiple terminology sets is a bridge between knowledge domains. Deeper knowledge is often conditional on other facts, or has specificity that is only understood by knowing a large constellation of facts. In either case, a significant number of domain-specific facts must be in place before depth is acquired.
